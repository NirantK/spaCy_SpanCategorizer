<h2> Why Span Categozier? </h2>

One line reason: More control over final predictions

Some ways in which this works:
- Can control recall via Suggester
- Can control inference speed via the number of suggestions
- Can use the same model/pipeline at different points of precision-recall curve depending on your latency and performance needs 


<h2> What are the differences between NER and Categozier? </h2>

- NER does not expose the confidence of each prediction, while Span Categozier does that
    -  NER is a fast, but not always accurate way to do NER
    -  Span Categozier is a slow, but accurate way to do NER
- Span Categozier is functionally a lot more flexible than NER
- Span Categozier also has more parameters that you can tune/control, while NER is more focused on a single task
- Both can be used together e.g. NER can be used to suggest spans of interest
- [Do a Speed Test] NER is faster/slower than Span Categozier, all else being equal [Insert Results here]

How can I use this component?
- Training the Span Categozier component is similar to training the NER component, but requires you to decide how you suggest spans. 
This also means you can use the same pipeline for NER and Span Categozier.

<h2> What are main things I'll have to develop in order to use this component? </h2>

- Spans Suggester

That is it. That is the only piece of code which you've to write. You can also use some of pre-written suggesters to get started.
